Background - We are looking at an employee - manager tree in an organization and the problem is to find a directect reportees and all reportees with a count under any given manager via an API based approach.

In this approach the data sample data is given to you, we dont recommend to use any DB for the same.

Given a dictionary that contains mapping of employee and his manager as a number of (employee, manager) pairs like below.

{ "A", "C" },
{ "B", "C" },
{ "C", "F" },
{ "D", "E" },
{ "E", "F" },
{ "F", "F" } 

In this example C is manager of A, 
C is also manager of B, F is manager 
of C and so on.

Create a  program/API to print   names and count of direct & all reports for a given employee in an organization. (Sample data is given in the form of excel Sheet)
